# Calories_Diet_Calculator

This project is intended to gain some Github and VCS management skills.


The idea is creating a Calculator that can suggest you what to eat, depending on your Diet neccessities.

The goals are:

1) Be able to retrieve from user Weigth, Size, Gender, Diet Goal, and Calories spent by exercising.

2) Be able to check nutritional tables and create a balanced composition based on the caloric goal described in previous step.

3) Be able to learn from user and suggest different meals to provide variety, and adapt to user.

4) As optional, it could check those raw materials, and find recipes that use it to make a higher level suggestion.
