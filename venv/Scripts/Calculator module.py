''' 
Our variables are 
WEIGHT float, kg

GENDER cathegorical, Man/woman
DIET GOAL (Cathegorical [for user], making it range on several intervals from -20 to +20% over Calories needed [float]
EXERCISE DONE (We can aproximate Cals depending on kind and duration of sport, as tables, integer)
OR, CALORIES BURNT (or we can directly input the burnt calories every day, integer)

    ###### User_ID ######

    # Still got no clear if I want to have this inside this function, or be called externally
    # the idea is this ID is unique, and must be incremented every time the function is called.
    # maybe nested functions?? Also I need a way to not allow someone already registered and with an assigned ID,
    # registering again (this would create duplicated entries )
