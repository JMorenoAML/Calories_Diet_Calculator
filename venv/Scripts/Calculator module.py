'''This module is intended to ingest data like WEIGTH, SIZE, GENDER, DIET GOAL...
 And then calculate the suggested Caloric Balance '''

''' 
Our variables are 
WEIGHT float, kg
SIZE float, cm
GENDER cathegorical, Man/woman
DIET GOAL (Cathegorical [for user], making it range on several intervals from -20 to +20% over Calories needed [float]
    { Let's define some intervals and cathegories, % applied over base BMR}
     Higher Weigth loss = -20%
     Normal Weigth loss = -10%
     Ligth weigth loss = -5%
     Keep this weigth = 0% (no changes)
     Ligth weigth gain = +5%
     Normal weigth gain = +10%
     Higher weigth gain = +20%
     
EXERCISE DONE (We can aproximate Cals depending on kind and duration of sport, as tables, integer)
    { Let's define some intervals: 
     TO do later, go on with coding 
OR, CALORIES BURNT (or we can directly input the burnt calories every day, integer)
